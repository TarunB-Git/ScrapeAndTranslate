                Chapter 1465: The Abyss of Dusu
                <br />
                The Road of the Gods Descending, as its name suggests, is a path used by mountain gods and sea gods to travel between mountains and seas. It allows people to go back and forth between east and west.
                <br />
                "The Record of Strange Beings in Mountains and Seas" is a very interesting book. Many contents recorded in it seem to be a depiction of the history of the Mountain Sea Realm. Most records can be found corresponding to them in the Mountain Sea Realm.
                <br />
                Among these descriptions that can be found in the Mountain Sea Realm and those that cannot, there are some that can be traced back to ancient times. Of course, there are also many legends that have never been seen anywhere else or whose authenticity is unknown.
                <br />
                Therefore, some people have always felt that the Mountain Sea Realm, which seems like our present world, actually exists in another dimension or parallel universe.
            </div>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>In the ancient era, a small world broke away due to the absence of human existence and thus preserved its historical appearance. This concept is far from being as popular as the theories about the heavens or the creation myths.

According to the legend recorded in the "Mountain Sea Demons", the mountain gods stationed at various locations would visit each other through a sacred path, playing games together on land and sea. However, after the earth cracked open, this path was cut off, causing the mountain gods to stop visiting each other.

Finding this path is extremely difficult. Fortunately, Jiang Wang had already obtained the inheritance at the Zhongba Mountain and knew the location of the mountain god's wall - which is actually the key gate of the sacred path. The North Polar Heavenly Vault Mountain cannot connect to the sacred path because the mountain god has disappeared; therefore, the mountain god's wall will not appear.

In other words, one must find opportunities in places where mountain gods or sea gods reside to access the mountain god's wall or the sea goddess' jade, allowing them to step onto the legendary rainbow bridge. Those animals granted divine names are incredibly formidable, making it extremely dangerous to attack without preparation. Jiang Wang took considerable time to deliberate before deciding to return with his companions to the Zhongba Mountain, recognizing that familiarity breeds contempt. Although navigating the complex geography of the Mountain Sea Realm remains challenging, Jiang Wang can still recall the route he has taken previously.The organization moved quickly and efficiently, sending the three people to their destination. However, due to their eye-catching appearance, they were taken away early on.

"Chapter of Jade: A mountain with a jade-like quality."

The gemstone white jade that covered the entire mountain was undoubtedly attractive.

Even Left Light Strange commented, "This mountain must be inhabited by a powerful deity!"

Although the five-tailed demon's temperament wasn't great, it seemed that if the three of them worked together harmoniously, they might still be able to reason with him.

Jiang Wang didn't know whether he was trying to reassure himself or others, but he suddenly led the way up the mountain without hesitation.

"Naturally, we can try to reason with him," Jiang Wang said casually, but where did he dare show his face in front of the five-tailed demon now?

This time was different from before.

Given how familiar they had become with Chapter Mountain, Moonlight Slave and Left Light Strange demonstrated remarkable expertise, employing various techniques for evading danger and staying hidden.

Without making a sound, the three of them blended into the surroundings like a gentle breeze, reaching the foot of Chapter Mountain without taking any unnecessary detours.Their target was clear - the wall of the mountain deity.
Fortunately, the five-tailed demon was nowhere to be found; he probably slept through it all.
"This mountain god wall looks... odd.""What's going on?" Moon Sky, with a furrowed brow, looked puzzled: "There seems to be a large piece missing here." Left Light Smile said, "It looks like we've been robbed!" Jiang Wang maintained his expressionless face: "Let's focus on the task at hand."

The three people almost simultaneously activated their martial arts techniques. The entire Chaozhai Mountain erupted into chaos for a moment! A flock of firebirds chirped and flew wildly around. Three puppet warriors, each wielding an iron club, rashly dislodged rocks from different directions.

Suddenly, a massive wave of water poured down the mountain, splitting into various shapes such as dragons, tigers, and leopards, which ran amok in all directions. In just one blink of an eye, the entire area was in turmoil. Even Five Tail Evil Zhent might wake up from her sleep, startled, unsure where to begin.

Aside from the chaos, the three people had already set up many magical traps along the path to the Heaven God Wall that Five Tail Evil Zhent would have to take. Of course, they wouldn't be able to block her directly, but if they could divert some of her attention or slow her down, it would suffice.As planned earlier, once the commotion started, the trio immediately emerged from hiding and flew towards the Heaven God Wall. Jiang Wang casually produced a seal stamp and pressed it onto the wall, following Left Light Smile's instructions. They used the name of Chaozhai God to activate the Divine Descent Path. The white jade pendant flashed briefly, radiating divine energy throughout the area.At the edge of the sky, a long rainbow appeared, shattering clouds and smoke across thousands of miles. It stretched over the Zhongguo Mountain and reached up to the heavens above, its origin unknown and destination unclear.

In front of them stood a mountain gate in the middle of the mountain god's wall, adorned with ancient carvings of beasts. Jiang Weng pressed his hand against the gate and urged, "You two go first."

Left Guangshu and Moon Slave did not hesitate, pushing open the gate together. Jiang Weng followed closely behind, using his three seals fire to quickly store away a large jade orb from the treasure box. He then pushed himself backward through the door.

Beyond the door lay the Rainbow Bridge, shimmering with colors amidst the deep clouds. The power of the mountain god's wall connected with the divine path leading to various "heavenly mansions" throughout the realm.Jiang Weng wondered if this might be the correct route through the Mountain Sea Realm... but how many could kill Bi Fang and obtain his pure blood to connect the mountain god's wall? The Mountain Sea Realm imposed strict limits on cultivation, making this path a mere fantasy for outsiders – although Left Guangshu had initially planned to rely on the nine phoenix feathers to ascend the divine path, thus considering North Polar Heavenly Treasury Mountain as their starting point. This intricate web of plans had already unraveled at the very first step, yet somehow managed to intertwine like this...It was very strange. The wind blew, but the people on the Rainbow Bridge didn't move. Left Guangshu's expression was a bit weird. The moon slave with the puppet face didn't have any expression, but its eyes flashed rapidly. It seemed that they hadn't missed Jiang Weng digging for treasure by hand.

"Don't destroy this door," said Jiang Weng naturally, "I'm worried that the evil bell will chase after us." He then commanded, "Look at the road, Guangshu, what am I doing? Do I have the map of Quanshan Cave on my face?"

As for Jiang Daoge, he still had an air of authority about him.

Left Guangshu turned back and focused intently on finding the Quanshan Cave mansion in the whirlpool-like scenery.

On the Rainbow Bridge high above the sky, there were no steps to take, yet people could ride the wind like electricity, passing through mountains and seas as if they were nothing. This was a truly novel experience.The speed of the Rainbow Bridge was simply astonishing.
There were huge distances between each floating mountain, and even the ones within sight weren't easily accessible; it was known as "chasing the mountain until death". However, standing on the Rainbow Bridge, it felt as though the floating mountains were right next to you, flashing past your eyes. The sea areas with mansions kept retreating into view.
But more than anything else, what left Jiang Weng anxious...It's astonishing... If each of the floating islands and every sea area on the path to divine descent represents a single mountain god or sea god, then there are countless supernatural creatures here. 
Doesn't the Qi country have such powerful gods? Is it only in Eastern lands?
At this moment, I realize that if this is indeed a real world, it would be incredibly powerful.
"Arrived!" Left Guangshu exclaimed suddenly.
The rainbow bridge came to a halt.
Jiang Wang looked up and saw only a dark whirlpool suspended before him.
Moonlight Slave stepped forward with gold light unfolding from his body: "I'll go first."
He only said one sentence before entering the whirlpool.
The waters of Xiongnan were fraught with danger; Moonlight Slave, being more resilient than Jiang Wang and the Puppet, ventured ahead to scout out the route. There was no room for extra talk.
Jiang Wang followed closely behind, stepping into the dark whirlpool.
Suddenly, he relaxed completely!
Jiang Wang almost felt himself lifted off the ground.
In the Mountain Sea Realm, one must constantly withstand forces several times greater than those in the mortal world – which isn't too difficult, actually..."This place is missing a huge piece." Left Light said with a smile, "It's as if we've been robbed." Jiang Wang's face remained expressionless, saying, "Let's get to work." The three of them almost simultaneously unleashed their martial arts skills. For a moment, the entire Chapter Mountain was filled with chaos! A flock of flaming birds flew wildly around, causing confusion everywhere. Three puppet warrior monks, each holding an iron club, started destroying rocks in different directions, acting extremely reckless. Then, a massive wave of water flooded the mountain, dividing into streams that transformed into dragons, tigers, and leopards, running wildly in all directions. In just one blink of an eye, the whole mountain erupted into noise, with chaos everywhere. Even Five-Tail Evil Copper must have woken up from his sleep, shocked by the commotion. Meanwhile, the other three had already laid many magical traps along the path of Five-Tail Evil Copper at the mountain god wall, designed to distract him or slow him down. According to their previous plan, when the chaos began, they immediately emerged from hiding and flew towards the mountain god wall. Jiang Wang casually pressed a seal on her hand onto the mountain god wall, following Left Light's instructions, using the name of Chapter Mountain God to open the Divine Descend Path. The white jade pendant flashed brightly for a moment, filling the air with sacred energy.As the group gazed at the distant rainbow, a majestic bridge spanning thousands of miles, they entered through a mysterious door in the mountain wall. The ancient door, adorned with intricate carvings, creaked open under Jiang Weng's hesitant touch. Without hesitation, Left Light Shu and Moon Sky Slave pushed past him, disappearing into the unknown.

Jiang Weng followed close behind, his hands moving swiftly as he activated the Three Immortal Flames to illuminate their path. A resplendent jade pendant materialized before them, which he promptly stowed away in his storage pouch.

With a deep breath, Jiang Weng propelled himself forward, and the door slammed shut behind him, revealing a breathtaking vista of seven-colored lights suspended amidst the clouds.

The divine energies emanating from the mountain wall converged with the Heavenly Path, granting access to numerous "divine abodes" scattered throughout the realm. Jiang Weng mused that perhaps this unorthodox route was indeed the most expedient means of traversing the Mountain Sea World.As he pondered the implications of their discovery, however, his thoughts were interrupted by the haunting memory of Bi Fang, whose untimely demise had severed the connection between the human world and the mystical realm. Yet, despite the formidable obstacles, Left Light Shu remained undeterred, driven by his unwavering determination to master the celestial arts.The wind blows gently, but it can't move the people on the Rainbow Bridge. Standing on the bridge, Left Light's face looks strange. The puppet-like Moon Slave has no expression, but its eyes sparkle. Clearly, they haven't missed Jiang Weng's careless act of digging up treasures.

"Don't destroy this door," Jiang Weng says naturally, "or that evil sword might catch up to us." Then he orders, "Look at the path, Left Light! What am I doing? Do I have a map of Qiongnan Spring on my face?"

Jiang Da Ge still exudes authority. Left Light turns around and heads back, focusing intently on finding Qiongnan Spring's mansion in the dazzling scenery.As we walk along the Rainbow Bridge, our steps seem frozen in place, yet we're swept away by the wind, taking in breathtaking views of mountains and seas. This is an exhilarating experience. The Rainbow Bridge moves incredibly fast.
Between each floating mountain, there are vast distances. Even within view, it's difficult to reach them quickly – it's like trying to chase after a distant dream. Yet from here, one mountain seems to touch another, flashing past us rapidly. The sea areas with mansions also recede endlessly from sight.But what worries Jiang Weng even more is...
At every floating mountain and ocean on the path of divine descent, there is a mountain god or sea god. The numerous creatures granted divine names in these realms are simply too many to count.

Doesn't Qi State have as many powerful gods as this? Doesn't all of Eastern China have such mighty beings? Only now do we see them spread out before us like this.

Jiang Wang finally realized that if these floating mountains and oceans were real worlds, they would be incredibly strong.Just then, Left General said, "We're here!" And the rainbow bridge came to a halt.
Jiang Wang looked up and saw only a dark whirlpool suspended before him.
The Moon Slave walked forward, her body gradually radiating golden light: "I'll go first."
She spoke no more than that before stepping into the whirlpool.
In the depths of Xunniangyuan, danger lurked around every corner; she had reason to believe that as a puppet's body, hers was even stronger than Jiang Wang's pair, so she ventured ahead to scout the way. She didn't say anything else unnecessary.
Jiang Wang followed closely behind, taking his own step into the dark whirlpool.
His whole person suddenly relaxed!
Jiang Wang almost floated away.
In the world of floating mountains and oceans, one must endure a force that is twice as heavy as what exists in reality - and he had grown accustomed to it.

"Complete Works: Simulation of the Beginning, You Are Too Extreme.
Complete Works: The Xu Family, Cultivating Longevity through Talismans."斗昭和姜望 are in the world of Wude in the depths of calamity, facing the lingering intentions of Yin and Yang, completing the tests, and gaining the inheritance of Yin and Yang. This inheritance is so orthodox that they can be said to represent contemporary Yin and Yang practitioners without question.

This inheritance was later supplemented in Yunxian Forest.

Doushao died and was reborn, while Jiang Wang guided souls through all three realms.

In the era of the saints in the past, the two virtuous ones, Zheng Shao and Zhao Fanlu, who completed the Yin and Yang doctrine, were the pinnacle of the cultivation of the Dao, so much so that they were called the "Little Saints of Yin and Yang."

But today's Doushao and Jiang Wang have already caught up.

Today, they are not exactly the same as the Yin and Yang virtuous ones.

Doushao, who controls the Yin side of the ghostly body, possesses the fierce power of lucid daydreams, known as grasping the Yin while holding the Yang.

Jiang Wang, who controls the Yang side of the human body, possesses the hidden power of the subconscious sea, known as grasping the Yang while holding the Yin.

They embody both Yin and Yang within themselves and reflect each other.

Their connection to the Yin and Yang family inheritance of destiny has never been their foundation but rather a path and support in their long journey of cultivation.

They will undoubtedly surpass the Yin and Yang virtuous ones and exist beyond them; no one doubts this.

This era, the most brilliant in history, has seen the birth of three transcendental beings in just four thousand years!Throughout the ages, the youngest Dongzhen, the strongest immortal, the youngest Daoist in history... everything in history is being overturned, all records are being renewed, and the names "Jiang Wang" and "Dou Zhao" are among the most dazzling names of the present day.

Today must triumph over the past.

In this moment when the Sanzu Bridge unfolds, the subconscious deep sea reflects the blazing sun of daydreams.

Jiang Wang, in a green robe with a sword, stands on this side of the black and white bridge with an instinctual alertness: "How do you know about this battle, and how do you know I am here?"

It is indeed a problem.

Phoenix Wei Zhen relentlessly pursues the "Nameless", and it has been a long time since, almost everyone is already used to it.

Used to the unpredictable changes in the Immortal Forest, accustomed to a battle that does not affect the mortal realm taking place, accustomed to this battle that has not reached a conclusion for a long time.

Zhuge Yi Xian's plan is even more unspeakable.

Only at the beginning of the final act, when triggering the existing arrangements, a fortuitous combination, and a psychic connection, the hunting journey begins.

Dou Zhao, who is still honing himself across various realms striving for the peak, should not have been involved in this plan.

Because a supreme force is not crucial to this battle, and because the Chu Kingdom should have higher expectations for Dou Zhao.

However, amidst the fluctuations in the Immortal Forest, Dou Zhao still received the message in time.

Not only did he know that a battle involving transcendence was taking place, but he also knew that Jiang Wang was participating in this battle.

Therefore, taking a step towards excellence, he knew.At the peak, knocking on doors thousands of miles away.</p><p>【Duel War】is his path, he will never retreat in this kind of war.</p><p>But he shouldn't have known the situation so quickly!

Ouyang Jie sat upright in the main hall, with the judicial iron whip behind him, resembling a band across his official hat.

He furrowed his brows because he had just received a reply from Left Qiuwu, the dean of the Diligent and Struggling Academy, and the information in it was too much to dissect word by word.

He and Left Qiuwu were on friendly terms.

Many people were aware of this, so it was not a secret.

During the central empire's suppression of the Equal Kingdom, Left Qiuwu was able to swiftly bring the academy's teacher, Zheng Wulou Mingbi, to surrender, partly due to this reason.

Of course, it was also because there were no clues linking Left Qiuwu to the Equal Kingdom, coupled with the influence of the Diligent and Struggling Academy and its consistent upright stance, that this special case was handled in this manner.

Left Qiuwu's response was to address the issues he had raised in his previous letter.

At that time, when he returned from the East Sea, he was shocked to see a bug leaving his body.He was eager to get involved in suppressing a true path, but he did not have the opportunity to personally investigate it in detail, so he deliberately passed on the information to more knowledgeable people in order to seek the truth.

He entrusted people in and outside of the country for help, but ultimately it was Lefty Quwu who was the most convincing in this regard.

"... This strange creature is so peculiar, yet it is not well-known, as if someone has erased its traces, hiding from the world.

"... When I was investigating this creature, it seemed like I was feeling a historical resistance.

"... Later, through immersing myself in the sea of ​​learning and climbing the mountain of books for research, I came across a fragment from the Middle Ages, which mentioned this creature with similar details. 'Gathered in a line, with a central abdomen, fifteen wings, nervous like human organs, its name is [Human Insect].'

"... Another ancient immortal's work, the 'Immortal Formula Classic,' mentioned: 'Dragging down the Milky Way, a fifteen-winged creature. Extremely strange, as if carved by the heavens.'

"... Furthermore, in the 'Thousand Beauties Chronicle of the Nations,' it is written, 'The Emperor played a trick on the Heavenly Empress, falsely presenting a nervous and heart-pounding creature for the enjoyment of the inner chambers.'..."

"All these varied sources serve as mutual validation, though not entirely reliable historical records. Taking them together to complement each other, like pieces of a broken jade fitting together, may form a complete picture—"

"The name of this creature is [Human Insect], passed down by the Dragging Down Clan. Its exact usage cannot be confirmed, and it should have the ability to deceive, serving as a key to celestial mysteries."

Cutting through the other content in the letter, the core information is just this.

Of course, in Lefty Quwu's style, he could stretch one word into ten, so the letter would not contain much in the way of pleasantries. Just the facts.This is a process of seeking evidence and detailed verification.

When he read the letter up to this point, Ouyang Jie could no longer sit still.

Humans are like insects, dragging their families, pointing to something too clear! He felt that a huge net had been spread out on the sea battlefield, and when Lord Qiantang of Jing State was fishing, he, as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Investigation Department, had also touched someone else's fishing hook!

Maybe even earlier...

The world is like a chess game, everyone is in the game.

But in any case, the retrospective investigation is now useless.

There is only one place to go now, and only one thing to do now--the Central Prison!

Although it has been only a few days since the involvement with the insects, it is already considered a long delay in such a critical situation. The purging of the First Sect of Yizhen Dao is already in its final stages. He, as the Chief Judge of the Criminal Investigation Department, should have stopped and sat down here to read the letter! He had found nothing from the various materials on the unusual insects that he had separately searched for.

There was no trace of the search for that flying insect.

And Wu Qiuwu's reply came very late.

The most terrifying thing... may have already happened!

Right at this moment.

Ouyang Jie felt something, raised his eyes, and among the crowd in the courtyard, he saw the Chief of the Taoist Office.Huang Shoujie. The person happened to be leaving his office and walking towards this direction with big steps. How to put it... This person in front of me is indeed Huang Shoujie, but at the same time, absolutely not Huang Shoujie.

The body is the same, but the movements, the gaze, even the temperament, all show too many differences. The most obvious point - Huang Shoujie is deep-minded, good at concealing, no matter what he's thinking, he would never stare at his superior so boldly!

Why not take the time to truly understand Huang Shoujie, and just walk out so impudently like this? In the eyes of Ou Yangjie, a master-level figure who has been in the criminal world for a long time, this is as eye-catching as running naked in the marketplace.

In his experience of handling cases, there have been countless fools, who are overconfident in their methods, yet failed due to a single word, a single glance - fools never learn their lesson.

If it's not occupying his body, it's equivalent to replacing his body! "Huang Daotai!"

Ou Yangjie had absolute confidence in his own judgment and acted decisively. By the time he called out this name, he had already taken action. His eyesight was sharp, the killing intent high, and his sword was already drawn and poised in the courtyard.

But at the same time, he also heard a voice calling out, "General Ou Yang!" 

Boom! His heart suddenly jumped.

Thump thump! Suddenly, the sound of gold and iron, war drums, and horse hooves resounded in his ears. He felt a sense of fear! Then came the unease, the hesitation.

He frowned because he had just received a reply from the dean of the Diligent Academy, Zuo Qiu Wu, and the information in it was too much, requiring careful consideration word by word.

He and Zuo Qiu Wu were friends.

Many people knew about this, so it wasn't a secret. During the Central Empire's crackdown on the Equal Nations, Zuo Qiu Wu was able to quickly bring the school teacher, Zheng Wulou Mingbi, to surrender, and this was one of the reasons for it.

Of course, it was also because there was no evidence linking Zuo Qiu Wu to the Equal Nations, combined with the influence of the Diligent Academy, and the academy's consistent principal stance, which led to this special treatment.

Zuo Qiu Wu's reply was in response to the questions he had raised in his earlier letter. At that time, when he returned from the East Sea, he was surprised to see a bug leaving his body.He was eager to participate in the suppression of a true path, but he did not investigate it personally and instead sought out people with more insight to seek the truth.

He asked for help from people both inside and outside of the country, but ultimately found Left Qi Wu to be the most convincing.

"...This strange insect is so peculiar, yet it is not well-known. It seems as if someone has erased its traces, hiding it from the world.

"...When investigating this insect, I seemed to sense a historical resistance.

"...After immersing myself in the sea of ​​learning and climbing the mountain of books to search for answers, I finally found a fragment of ancient text, which recorded this insect with similar details. 'It has a belly with a heart, fifteen wings, and a disposition similar to that of human organs. Its name is [Human Insect].'

"...In an ancient text from later times, the immortal teacher mentioned, 'Dragging down the Milky Way, a fifteen-winged insect. It is incredibly strange, like a carved celestial sound.'

"...There is also a mention in the "Legend of a Thousand Beauties of Various Countries," 'Emperor Wu played with the Heavenly Empress, using the deceitful and stomach-turning insect as a pleasure for the harem.'

"...All these various accounts corroborate each other. Although they are not all part of official history, when pieced together, they form a mosaic of truth.

"...This insect is called the [Human Insect], passed down by the Dragging Down family. Its exact purpose is unverifiable, but it seems to have a deceptive ability, capable of serving as a guide for celestial mechanisms."

Peeling away the other contents of the letter, the core information is just this. Of course, in Left Qi Wu's style, one word could be split into ten. There wouldn't be much pleasantries in the letter, just the essential information.This is the process of seeking chapter citations, detailed evidence. When Eu Yangjie read the letter to this point, he could no longer sit still. People and insects, dragging down the clan, the direction is too clear! He felt that a huge net had been cast, on the sea battlefield it had already been spread out, and when Qiantang Jun was fishing in Jingguo, as the Chief Inspector, he had also touched someone else's hook! Or perhaps even earlier. The whole world is like a chess game, everyone is in the game. But no matter what, tracing it afterwards would be useless. There is only one place to go now, only one thing to do now - the Central Prison! Since the day he got involved with insects, although it has only been a few days, in such a critical situation, it has already been a long delay - the leader of Yizhen Dao, Zong Dezhen, has already been executed, and this massive purge against Yizhen Dao is in its final stages. As the Chief Inspector, he can stop now and sit here reading the letter! He found no results in the various information about the strange insects he had searched himself. There was no trace of the search for that flying insect. And Lou Qiu's reply came very late. The most terrible thing... may have already happened! Right at this moment. Eu Yangjie had a sense of something, raised his eyes, and in the flow of people coming and going in the courtyard, he saw the Chief of the Dao Tai Bureau.Huang Shoujie. The person in front of him was just leaving his office, striding over towards him.

How should I put it? The person in front of him is indeed Huang Shoujie, but at the same time, he is definitely not Huang Shoujie.

The body is the same, but the actions, the look in the eyes, even the demeanor, are all different.

The most obvious point - Huang Shoujie is deep in thought, excellent at concealing it, no matter what he is thinking, he would never look at his superior so unabashedly!

Why not take the time to understand Huang Shoujie properly, and just walk out so boldly? In the eyes of a master like Ouyang Jie who has been in the law for so long, this is like running naked in the marketplace, very conspicuous.

In his experience of handling cases, there are countless fools who are self-righteous and proficient in their methods, but fail because of a single word or a look - fools never learn from their mistakes.

If you don't occupy his body, it's equivalent to replacing his body!

"Huang Daotai!"

Ouyang Jie has absolute confidence in his judgment, and his actions are very decisive. By the time he shouted this name, he had already taken action. His eyes traverse with a killing intent, and his sword crosses decisively in the courtyard.

But at the same time, he heard a voice saying, "Chief Ouyang!"

Boom!

His heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Thud, thud!

Suddenly, the sounds of gold and iron horses, war drums resounded, and he felt a sense of fear! And then came uneasiness, awkwardness.He felt like his body was split in two, with one half struggling upwards and the other half desperately moving downwards. Anxious and uneasy. Up and down. It wasn't until now that he realized a fact— the human insect had not left. Or rather, the departure was only the image of the human insect, not its significance. From start to finish, the human insect's target was only him, the chief inspector. No matter how he checked himself, he couldn't find any issues. Because the real crisis would only erupt at this moment. The human insect was never a threat to him, so he couldn't detect it. What really influenced him was another presence not in sight. He suddenly understood the words Left-Qiu Wu wrote in the letter— “When investigating this insect, I seem to feel a historical resistance.” That resistance is real! All the coincidences were prearranged. It wasn't that Left-Qiu Wu researched slowly or that he, Ouyang Jie, was lacking in knowledge. It was that his understanding of the "human insect" was impossible to achieve before this moment. There was a high power governing this process, with boundaries that no one could surpass. No matter what accidents occurred, they couldn't prevent it from happening.And this, isn't this the means of that person?!</p><p>When did he actually loosen the seal, and could release such a power close to a miracle?!</p><p>A thousand waves surged in the heart, but the hands supported the chair, unable to stand up.</p><p>Just this moment of losing control, Ouyang Jie's gaze was already dissected by Huang Shoujie's gaze. His eyes flickered, and the body that was about to rise up fell back and sat back in the high chair representing the Chief of the Imperial Investigation Department!</p><p>The officers of the investigation department who were walking in the courtyard only saw the two heads of the department within, greeting each other warmly, like brothers, secretly admiring the grandstanding of the high-ranking officials.</p><p>Huang Shoujie walked forward in big strides and went straight to the hall to pay respects: "Chief, it happens that you are also in the yamen, and there is an important matter for the subordinate to report!"</p><p>He walked up to Ouyang Jie like this, made a proper salute, pretended to whisper, and after a moment, he raised his hand and took off the iron whip of the investigation department that was placed behind Ouyang Jie.</p><p>"I respectfully obey the command of the Chief, I will take care of this matter personally!"</p><p>Huang Shoujie gave a formal official courtesy to Ouyang Jie, and then said, "So I won't disturb you. You have been too exhausted recently, rest well for a few days, and I will take care of the rest of the matters."</p><p>With the investigation department's iron whip in hand, he walked out, respectfully exited, held the door handle with both hands, and slowly closed the main door of the hall.</p><p>Starlight and moonlight couldn't pour into the light of the investigation department.The most majestic and imposing yamen in the Three Departments of this imperial city, slowly closed its view in the scattered eyes of Ouyang Jie.

Although the prefectural yamen was bustling with people, not a single official dared to approach and listen.

Ouyang Jie remained silently in his main hall.

The Chief Superintendent of the Judicial Office personally relayed the instructions from the Chief of the Dao Tai Office. Who would have such a hard head to bear the risks?

It can be foreseen that for a long time, no one will disturb Ouyang Jie.

Huang Shoujie thought for a moment, then took down the legal cord in front of the hall and stood in front of the closed doors, instructing, "Go, bring the suspect Luo Jiangyue over. I, under the orders of the Central Council, am going to personally escort her to the central prison!"

Ouyang Jie, the dignified Chief Superintendent of the Judicial Office, possessed unparalleled cultivation and held the highest judicial power in the entire Central Empire.

Even if it were a divine swordsman, it would be impossible to kill him in Tianjing City without a sound.

Controlling Huang Shoujie, like controlling him, was absolutely impossible.

Even if there were the same conditions and opportunities, the status and attention that Ouyang Jie received were completely on a different level.

Now, to control him and lock him in the seat of the Chief of Judicial Affairs, was already a remarkable step.

This is the core area, core position, and core figure of the Central Empire!<p>黄守介要的，本来也不是欧阳颉的性命。他需要的缉刑铁鞭，已经握在手中。</p><p>很快便有两名资深执司，用囚车装了楼江月，将她推至堂院中来。</p><p>囚车外面还蒙了一层布，以蔽囚犯之貌，不使失颜。</p><p>缉刑司当然不是对犯人这么友好的地方……但这毕竟是楼约的女儿，欧阳颉亲自去御史台接回来的囚犯，他们不用轿子抬着，已经是很守规矩了。</p><p>黄守介淡淡地看了囚车一眼，很自然地道：“此为总长交代下来的公务，倒也不用特意叫人。就你们两个带路，咱们往中央天牢走一遭。”</p><p>如此就避开了不熟悉自己亲信的问题，且真找熟悉黄守介的亲信随行，还容易暴露。</p><p>这些个鹰衙猎犬，狗鼻子都灵得很。</p><p>他又道：“衙中有什么紧要事情，先转与其他两位道台。事不能决，就等我回来处理。不要打扰总长。”</p><p>属吏皆低头应声。</p><p>两名执司很高兴地将囚车抬进缉刑司的官车中，驾着这辆马车往中央天牢去。</p><p>“皇城三司”说起来像是一个体系，实则各自为政，完全不同。但这么多年来彼此合作，也算是知根知底。</p>Lou Jiangyue's identity and guilt destined her to descend to the lowest level of the Central Dungeon.

The Investigative Division's carriage stopped outside the Central Dungeon, the Investigative Division's prisoner carriage stopped at the first gate of the Central Dungeon, and the Investigative Division's two officers stopped at the third gate.

The group was stripped layer by layer.

On this bottom level, only Huang Shoujie led Lou Jiangyue.

The guard at the door, locked in a stone cap, only instructed them to keep moving forward, with no other indication.

Drip! Drip! Drip!
The constant dripping sound was like a cruel blade cutting.

Those imprisoned here were all being tortured by time.

In this pitch-black darkness where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, walking down a deep and seemingly endless path, only the eternal drip, suffocating those inside to the point of wanting to crush their own hearts.

Fortunately, Lou Jiangyue was numb to everything, and Huang Shoujie had no inhibitions.

They slowly walked forward, until they emerged from the deep darkness and saw the emaciated and hunched figure of Sang Xianshou.

The Emperor pardoned Lou Jiangyue's death sentence, granting her an infinite term of imprisonment.

Of course, this couldn't be conveyed in a clear order.

But Sang Xianshou, who oversaw the Central Dungeon, naturally knew the outcome and could better gauge Lou Yue's status.

After all, the Investigative Division was not a place specifically for holding prisoners, so moving Lou Jiangyue to the Central Dungeon was only logical.Although Sangxianshou had not received prior notice of the visit, a chief from the Dao Tai department personally brought the prisoner over, so there was no issue with the protocol. "Huang, the Dao Tai." Sangxianshou's somber voice resonated, "Truly a rare sight." "I hope it won't be me who comes next time." Huang Shoujie glanced at him, "The culprits have been brought, please verify their identity, Sir Sang." "No problem. It is indeed... Lou Jiangyue," Sangxianshou confirmed. "Then I'll take my leave," Huang Shoujie said as he turned to leave. He came in clean and left swiftly. No one, not even a chief from the Dao Tai department, wanted to linger in the central dungeon for long. Lou Jiangyue kept his head bowed, motionless and silent, as if already dead, yet still alive. Having seen countless people resigned to their fate, Sangxianshou didn't find it surprising. He simply stood in the darkness, silently watching Huang Shoujie depart, ensuring no untoward incident occurred. Only when he was certain that nothing unexpected had happened did he put away the prison bell that was always held in his hand— not aimed at Huang Shoujie specifically, but poised to ring at the slightest interruption in his transmission of divine thoughts. Whenever such a lapse occurred, the prison bell would ring, and the entire central dungeon would be sealed. It was the highest level of alert since the dungeon's construction. At any time, no matter what happened, Sangxianshou remained vigilant enough for such a scenario.Heaven’s Central Prison, the darkest place in Tianjing City, where the most dangerous criminals were kept. But even in this dark and dangerous place, there was a glimmer of hope, symbolized by a ray of light that shone through a narrow grille, forming a beautiful "well" shape on the ground. It was as if this light represented the only hope in this otherwise bleak and hopeless place.

Luo Jiangyue, the daughter of Luo Yue, was brought here, causing trouble for Sang Xianshou, the gatekeeper. Sang Xianshou couldn't torture her, and any mishap with her would be his responsibility. Heaven's Central Prison was no place for relaxation or recovery.

As Sang Xianshou dragged Luo Jiangyue into the darkness, the sound of chains rattled, and the dripping of water echoed in the air. Even in the deepest depths of Heaven's Central Prison, darkness wasn't eternal. When the morning star appeared at its fixed time, light would always find its way in.

Coincidentally, this was that moment. As Sang Xianshou pulled Luo Jiangyue further into the darkness, the light of the morning star shone through the narrow grille, creating a beautiful "well" shape on the ground, symbolizing the only hope in this desolate place.

What happens on earth, heaven does not know. But in the well within, the moon knows not what year it is.<p>  Years and months have passed, countless.</p><p>  Time flows with dreams!</p><p>  Just like every year, every day, in the past.

Ouyang Jie sat upright in the main hall, the interrogation iron whip behind him like a brim of his official hat.

He frowned because he had just received a reply from the president of the Diligence Academy, Zuoqiu Wu, and the information in it was too much to digest word by word.

He and Zuoqiu Wu had a private relationship.

Many people knew about this, and it was not a secret.

When the Central Imperium cleansed the Equal Kingdom before, Zuoqiu Wu was able to quickly bring the supervisor of the school, Zheng Wulou Mingbi, to surrender, and this was one of the reasons.

Of course, it was also because there was no evidence linking Zuoqiu Wu to the Equal Kingdom, combined with the school's inherent influence and its consistent upright stance, that this special case was handled in this way.

Zuoqiu Wu's reply was in response to the questions he had raised in his previous letter.

At that time, returning from the East Sea, he was surprised to see a insect leave his body. At that moment, he was eager to participate in suppressing a true way but was unable to investigate personally. However, he deliberately passed on the information to someone more knowledgeable in order to seek the truth.

He was concerned both inside and outside the Kingdom of Jing.I asked someone for help, but ultimately it is Left Qiuwu who is more convincing in this matter.

"The insect is so strange, yet obscure, I have not heard of it, perhaps someone has erased its traces, hiding it from the world.

"While investigating this insect, I seemed to feel a historical resistance.

"When I searched the sea of ​​learning and climbed the mountain of books, poring over ancient texts, I found a fragment from the Middle Ages, which mentioned this insect, with details similar. 'Referred to as a thread, with a heart in its abdomen, fifteen wings above, eight below, named Human Insect.'

"In more recent ancient scriptures, the 'Immortal Sutra' refers to 'drawing down the Milky Way, with a fifteen-winged insect. The most mysterious of creatures, it carves the cry of the heavens.'

"And in the 'Thousand Beauties Chronicle of the States,' it is said, 'Emperor Wu played with the Heavenly Empress, deceptively using an insect with a heart in its belly, for the enjoyment of the boudoir.'...

"All these instances reinforce each other, while not all being verifiable historical records. Taking the good and the bad as a whole, piecing together fragments of truth, it may serve as evidence--

"The name of this insect is the 'Human Insect,' passed down in the Yueluo Tribe. Its actual purpose cannot be confirmed, but it seems to have a deceitful power, serving as a guide for celestial mechanisms."

Peeling away the other content of the letter, the core message is just that.

Of course, in Left Qiuwu's style, he would break one word into ten if possible, and there would not be much small talk on the letter. It would just be a series of references and detailed evidence.

Reading this letter, Ouyang Jie could no longer sit still.

Human Insect, from the Yueluo Tribe.too obvious!<br/>He felt like a huge net had been cast out on the sea battlefield, even as Lord Buru was fishing in Qiantang, he, as the Chief Minister of Judicial Executions, had also touched someone else's hook! Perhaps even earlier than that...<br/>  The world is like a game of chess, with everyone being a player on the board.<br/>  But no matter what, any subsequent investigations would be of no use.<br/>  There is only one place to go, only one thing to do now—<br/>  The Central Penitentiary!<br/>  Even though it's only been a few days since the incident involving the human and the insect, it feels like a long time has passed due to the urgent situation—One True Dao leader Zong Dezhen has already been executed, and the great purge against the One True Dao is entering its final stages. He, as the Chief Minister of Judicial Executions, should have stopped to sit here and read letters!<br/>  His own exploration of various exotic insect materials has yielded no results.<br/>  There is no trace left in the search for that flying insect.<br/>  And Leftfield's reply came in very late.<br/>  The most dreadful thing... may have already happened!<br/>  Just then.<br/>  Ouyang Jie had a feeling and raised his eyes, only to see the Chief of the Daoist Office, Huang Shoujie, in the crowd passing by the courtyard. He happened to be leaving his office and walking this way briskly.<br/>  How should we put it? The person in front of him was indeed Huang Shoujie, but it was absolutelyThis is not Huang Shoujie.
The body is still the same body, but the actions, gaze, and even temperament are all very different.
The most obvious point - Huang Shoujie is deep in thought, very good at concealing, no matter what he is thinking inside, he would never look at his superiors in such a bold manner!
Why not take the time to really understand Huang Shoujie, and just walk out so boldly like this?
In the eyes of Master Ouyang Jie, who has been in the police system for a long time, this is no different from running naked in the market, very conspicuous.
In his experience of handling cases, there are countless idiots who are full of themselves and fail due to just a few words or a look in the eyes - fools never learn their lesson.
Not occupying his body is the same as replacing his body!
"Huang Taishi!"
Ouyang Jie had absolute confidence in his judgment, and his actions were very decisive. When he called out that name, he had already taken action. His eyes were sharp, his killing intent was strong, and he raised his sword in the court.
But at the same time, he also heard a voice saying "Chief Ouyang!"
Bang!
His heart suddenly started pounding.
Thump thump!
Suddenly, the sounds of golden war drums and clattering swords and horses could be heard, and he felt fear!
Then came the uneasiness and hesitation.
His body seemed to split in half, one half trying to go up, the other half desperately trying to go down.
Nervous and anxious.>  He was feeling a bit disoriented, as if he had lost all sense of direction. The situation had left him feeling a bit bewildered, his mind in turmoil. He couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss, something not quite right. It was as if a shadow loomed over him, casting a sense of unease over everything he did.

>  He looked around, but everything seemed normal. There was no sign of anything out of the ordinary. Yet, deep down, he knew that something was off. It was as if he was being watched, scrutinized by unseen eyes.

>  Suddenly, he felt a chill run down his spine. It was as if a cold, clammy hand had touched him. He shivered, a sense of dread creeping over him. He couldn't quite put his finger on what was wrong, but he knew that danger was near.

>  He looked up, a sense of foreboding gripping his heart. He knew that something was about to happen, something that would change everything. And then, it hit him like a ton of bricks — the real threat was not the person-insect, but something else entirely.

>  As he stood there, with his mind racing, he finally understood one thing — the person-insect had never truly left. Or perhaps, it was just the physical form that had left, not the essence. From the beginning to the end, the person-insect's target had always been him, the chief of the Investigation Department.

>  No matter how much he introspected, he couldn't find anything wrong. Because the true crisis was yet to unfold. The person-insect had never posed any real threat to him; what would truly affect him was another presence not currently visible.

>  He suddenly realized the significance of the phrase in Left Qiuwu's letter — "When investigating this insect, I seemed to sense a historical resistance." That resistance was real!

>  All the chance events were part of a grand design. It wasn't that Left Qiuwu was slow in gathering information, or that he, Ouyang Jie, was lacking in knowledge; it was the fact that his understanding of the person-insect could only come at this moment.

>  There was a higher power at play, sketching out this process. It had its boundaries, beyond which no one could trespass. No accident, however unexpected, could derail its execution.

>  And wasn't this the handiwork of that particular being?!

>  When did the seal loosen, allowing the release of such a remarkable power?In the heart, waves of turmoil surged, but he sat holding onto the chair, unable to stand up. It was just this moment of losing control, that Eu Yangjie's gaze was already pierced by Huang Shoujie's eyes. His eyes scattered for a moment, and his body, which had intended to stand up, fell back down, sitting back on the chair representing the Chief of the Imperial Criminal Investigation Department!

The officers of the Criminal Investigation Department passing through the courtyard only saw the two leaders of the department warmly greeting each other like brothers, marveling at the dignitaries' social skills.

Huang Shoujie strode forward and went straight to the hall for formal discussion, "Chief, fortunately you are in the yamen. I have an important matter to report!" He walked up to Eu Yangjie, made a proper bow, feigned a whispering posture for a moment, then raised his hand and took down the iron whip placed behind Eu Yangjie.

"I humbly obey the Chief's orders, I will personally handle this matter!"

Huang Shoujie performed a formal official ceremony towards Eu Yangjie and said, "With your permission, I will take care of it. You have overworked yourself lately, take a few days to rest, I will handle the rest."

Carrying the iron whip of the Criminal Investigation Department, Huang Shoujie walked out, respectfully bowed, and then exited, closing the main door of the hall slowly.

The light of the stars and moon couldn't penetrate the light of the lamps in the Criminal Investigation Department.

In Eu Yangjie's distracted gaze, the grand and imposing gate of the Criminal Investigation Department slowly closed, enveloping its scene.The governmental office was bustling with people coming and going, but not a single official dared to approach to listen.

Ouyang Jie remained silent in his main hall.

The Chief Director of the Criminal Investigation Department personally received instructions from the Chief of the Judicial Yuan. Who would be so stubborn as to bear the risks?

It is foreseeable that for a long time, no one will disturb Ouyang Jie.

Huang Shoujie thought for a moment, then removed the law rope from in front of the hall and stood in front of the closed doors. He commanded, "Bring the prisoner Lu Jiangyue here. I have been ordered by the Chief of the Judicial Yuan to personally escort her to the central imperial prison!"

Ouyang Jie, as the prestigious Chief Director of the Criminal Investigation Department with unparalleled martial arts skills, held the highest judicial power in the entire Central Empire.

Even a divine martial artist wouldn't be able to kill him in the city of Tianting without causing any commotion.

It's impossible to control him like Huang Shoujie. Even with the same conditions and opportunities, Ouyang Jie and Huang Shoujie are entirely on different levels and levels of attention they receive.

Now, to have him under control, locked in the seat of the Director of Criminal Investigation, is already a remarkable achievement.

This is the core area, core position, and core figure of the Central Empire!

And what Huang Shoujie needed was not Ouyang Jie's life to begin with. The whip of criminal investigation was already in his hands.

Soon, twoThe senior officers used a prisoner car to transport Lou Jiangyue, pushing her into the courtyard. The prisoner car was covered with a layer of cloth outside to conceal the appearance of the prisoner and preserve her dignity.

The Inspectorate of Legal Affairs is certainly not a friendly place for prisoners... but this is Lou Yue's daughter after all, a prisoner personally brought back by Ouyang Jie from the Ministry of Punishments. They did not use a sedan chair to carry her, which was already following the rules.

Huang Shoujie casually glanced at the prisoner car, and calmly said, "This is a task handed down by the chief, so there is no need to notify anyone. You two lead the way, and let's head to the central dungeon." 

This way, they could avoid the issue of not being familiar with their own trusted subordinates, and bringing familiar subordinates who know Huang Shoujie could easily expose them.

Those officials of the Inspectorate are as sharp as hounds.

Huang Shoujie continued, "If there is anything urgent in the office, transfer it to the other two officials. If a decision cannot be made, wait for me to come back and handle it. Do not disturb the chief."

The subordinates all nodded in response.

The two officers were happy to carry the prisoner car into the official carriage of the Inspectorate and drove towards the central dungeon.

The "Three Offices of the Imperial City" sound like a system, but in reality, they each have their own authority and are completely independent. However, after many years of cooperation, they also know each other quite well.

Due to Lou Jiangyue's identity and charges, she was destined to be taken to the lowest level of the central dungeon.

The Inspectorate's carriage stopped outside the central dungeon, awaiting further instructions.The prison wagon stopped at the first gate in the central dungeon, with two guards from the judicial department standing at the third gate.

The prisoners were stripped layer by layer.

On this lowest level, only Huang Shoujie led Luo Jiangyue.

The guard at the door locked in the stone helmet only told them to keep moving forward, without any other instructions.

Tick! Tick! Tick!
The constant dripping sound seemed like a cruel knife slicing through time.

Those imprisoned here were all being tortured by time.

In this pitch-dark place where you couldn't see your own hand in front of your face, walking down a deep, endless path, with only the sound of dripping lasting forever, made people want to crush their own hearts.

Fortunately, Luo Jiangyue was numb to it all, and Huang Shoujie had no taboos.

They slowly moved forward until they emerged from the deep darkness into the thin, hunched figure of Sang Xianshou.

The Emperor pardoned Luo Jiangyue's death sentence and granted him an indefinite term.

Of course, this could not be given as a clear order.

But Sang Xianshou, who was in charge of the central dungeon, naturally knew the result, and was more able to weigh Luo Yue's worth.

The judicial department was after all not a place specifically for holding prisoners, so moving Luo Jiangyue to the central dungeon was a logical step.

Although Sang Xianshou had not received any prior notice, a senior official from the Judicial Office personally brought the prisoner over, so there was no problem with the etiquette.<trans>“Huang Daotai.” The melancholic voice of Sang Xianshou sounded: “Truly a rare visitor.”

“I hope next time it won't be me personally.” Huang Shoujie glanced at him: “The suspect has been brought, please verify the identity, Daoren Sang.”

“No problem. It is indeed... Lou Jiangyue,” said Sang Xianshou.

“Then I will take my leave.” Huang Shoujie turned around and left. He came cleanly and left decisively.

No one, including officials from the Daotai Office, would want to linger in the Central Prison for long.

Lou Jiangyue kept her head bowed, hair covering her face, motionless and silent, as if already dead but still alive.

Having seen many who resigned to their fate, Sang Xianshou did not find it peculiar.

He simply stood in the darkness, silently watching Huang Shoujie depart, ensuring there were no unexpected occurrences. He put away the prison bell that he had been holding in his hand all along—not specifically for Huang Shoujie, but for anyone who came here, he maintained sufficient vigilance.

If his transmitted divine thoughts were interrupted for a moment, the prison bell would ring, and the entire Central Prison would be sealed off. The highest alert since the prison's establishment would be triggered.

At any time, no matter what happened, this place always had the most adequate preparation to deal with the most unpredictable dangers.

Of course, these dangers never materialized.

Ouyang Jie sat in the main hall, with the interrogation iron whip behind him, like a line across his official hat.

He frowned because he had just received a reply from the head of the diligent study academy, Left Qiu Wu, and the information in it was too much to decipher word by word.

He and Left Qiu Wu had a private relationship.

This was widely known and not a secret.

During the central imperial campaign to eradicate the Equality Kingdom, Left Qiu Wu was able to quickly bring in the teaching master Zheng Wuliuming Bi from the academy, mainly due to this reason.

Of course, it was also because there was no evidence linking Left Qiu Wu to the Equality Kingdom, in addition to the influence of the diligent study academy and its consistent upright stance, which led to this special handling.

Left Qiu Wu's reply was in response to the issues he had raised in his earlier letter.

At that time, returning from the East Sea, he saw a strange insect leaving his body. In his haste to participate in the suppression of a true Daoist, he did not investigate it personally, but specifically passed the information to someone more knowledgeable to find out the truth.

He had asked people both inside and outside Jingguo, but Left Qiu Wu's opinions were generally more convincing in this regard.Erasing all traces, hiding from the world.

"...While investigating this insect, I seemed to sense a historical resistance.

"During my studies and research, delving into the sea of knowledge and climbing the mountain of books, I came across an ancient fragment that mentions this insect, with details similar. 'A body like a thread, with a central abdomen, seven upper wings, eight lower wings, and fifteen in total. It hangs its heart like human viscera, named 【人虫】.'

"Also, in the writings of the ancient immortal scholars, the 'Book of Immortal Methods' mentions: 'Dragging down the Heavenly River, a fifteen-winged insect. Extraordinarily mysterious, capable of engraving symbols in the sky.'

"And in the 'Thousand Beauties Chronicles of the Nations,' it is written, 'The Emperor of War played with the Celestial Empress, using the deceitful insect with a hanging heart as a pleasure in the palace'...

"All these various references, mutually validate each other, though not all entirely historical, but taken together, they complement each other. Like piecing together broken jade to form a complete piece, or completing a sentence—"

"The name of this insect is 【人虫】, passed down through the lineages of the Yueluo tribe, its exact function cannot be confirmed, but it should have deceptive abilities capable of being the guidance of celestial mechanisms."

Peeling away the other content of the letter, the core information is just this.

Of course, in the style of Zuoqiu Wu, it is impossible not to break a word into ten words to use, and there will not be too much politeness in the letter. It is simply the process of seeking references and detailed evidence.

Reading this letter up to this point, Ouyang Jie could no longer sit still.

人虫, Yueluo tribe, the direction is too clear!
He felt a huge web had been laid out on the sea battlefield, even when Qiantang Junbolu was fishing, he felt this.The chief of the judicial office has been implicated, which also involves other people's secrets!
Or even earlier than that...
The world is like a chess game, everyone is a player.
But no matter what, the investigation afterwards is useless.
There is only one place to go now, and only one thing to do now – the central prison!
Although it has been only a few days since the incident involving the human-mosquito, it has been delayed for far too long in such a critical situation - the first leader of the Yizhendao sect has already been beheaded, and the purge against the Yizhendao has entered its final stages. As the chief of the judicial office, he can stop and sit down to read the letter!
He has found no results from the various insect information he personally searched for.
There is no trace of the search for that flying insect.
And Left Qiu's reply came very late.
The most terrible thing... may have already happened!
Just at this moment.
Ouyang Jie felt something, raised his eyes, and in the flow of people coming and going in the courtyard, he saw the head of the Dao Tai office, Huang Shoujie. The man happened to be leaving his office and striding towards him.
How should I put it. This person in front of him is indeed Huang Shoujie, but he is absolutely not Huang Shoujie.
The body is still the same, but the movements, the eyes, and even the demeanor are different too much.
The mostIt is clear that Huang Shoujie is deep in thought, very good at disguising his feelings, and will never look at his superiors so brazenly, no matter what he is thinking. Why not take the time to understand Huang Shoujie and just walk out like this? In the eyes of the master like Ouyang Jie, who has been in the criminal justice field for a long time, this is akin to streaking in the busy marketplace, very conspicuous. In his experience of handling cases, there have been countless fools who were self-righteous and failed due to a single word or a single glance—fools never learn from their mistakes. If you don't occupy his body, you are replacing his body! "Master Huang!" Ouyang Jie was absolutely confident in his judgment, and his actions were very resolute. When he called out the name, he had already begun to act. But at the same time, he heard a voice saying, "Director Ouyang!" Bam bam! His heart suddenly skipped a beat. Thump thump! Suddenly the sound of war drums and the clash of swords and spears resounded, and he inexplicably felt a sense of fear! And then came uneasiness and a sense of discomfort. It was as if his body was split in two, one half pushing upwards, the other half desperately pulling downwards. It was a feeling of nervousness. Up and down. It wasn't until this moment that he realized one fact—the person had not left.> Perhaps it can be said that the departure that time was only of the appearance of the man-insect, not the significance of the man-insect.
> From beginning to end, the man-insect's goal was only himself as the chief inspector of the law enforcement bureau.
> No matter how he inspects himself, he cannot find any problems.
> Because the real crisis will only erupt at this moment.
> The man-insect himself was harmless, so he couldn't perceive it, what really was going to affect him was another existence not present before him.
> Suddenly, he understood the sentence left by Zuoqiu Wu in the letter - "When I was investigating this insect, I seemed to sense a historical resistance."
> That kind of resistance really exists!
> All the coincidences were all arranged long ago.
> It was not because Zuoqiu Wu was slow in researching, nor was it because of Ouyang Jie's lack of knowledge, it was that his understanding of the "man-insect" could never have been obtained before this moment.
> There is a kind of high power that exists in the mysterious, depicting such a process. There are boundaries in it that no one can cross.
> Regardless of any accidents, they cannot affect its realization.
> And, isn't this the means of that one?!
> When did He actually loosen the seal, and could release a power close to a miracle?
> There were waves of turmoil in his heart, but his hands were resting on the chair and could not get up.
> Just losing control for a moment, Ouyang Jie's gaze was now.Under the gaze of Huang Shoujie, his eyes seemed to dissect him. In a moment, his gaze scattered, and Dao, who had intended to stand up, sat back in the chair representing the Chief of the Imperial Inquisitorate! 

The officials of the Inquisitorate passing through the courtyard could only see the two top leaders of the department warmly greeting each other, appearing as close as brothers, secretly marveling at the grandeur and skill of the high-ranking officials. 

Huang Shoujie strode forward and went straight to the hall to pay his respects: "Chief, you happen to be in the office as well. There is an important matter I need to report!"

He approached Euronyoung and made a formal bow, pretending to whisper for a moment before raising his hand and taking down the iron whip placed behind Euronyoung. 

"I obey the orders of the Chief, I will personally handle this matter!"

Huang Shoujie performed a well-organized official ceremony to Euronyoung and said: "In that case, I won't disturb you. You have been overworking yourself lately, take a few days to rest, leave the rest to me."

He walked out with the iron whip, politely closing the main door of the hall while holding the door handle with both hands. 

Moonlight and starlight could not pour into the light of the Inquisitorate. 

Amidst the hustle and bustle of the officials in the imperial city, in Euronyoung's scattered gaze, the grand and majestic scene of the Inquisitorate slowly closed its view. 

Despite the continuous flow of people in the governmental office, not a single official dared to approach and listen. 

Euronyoung remained silent in his main hall.The Chief Judicial Officer personally explained to the Chief Justice what kind of a person would have the audacity to withstand such risks. It can be foreseen that for a long period of time, no one will disturb Ouyang Jie.

Huang Shoujie thought for a moment, then took down the legal cord outside the hall. Standing in front of the tightly closed gate, he ordered, "Bring the prisoner Lou Jiangyue over. By order of the Supreme Council, I will personally escort her to the Central Heavenly Prison."

Ouyang Jie, the esteemed Chief Judicial Officer, possessed supreme martial abilities and held the highest judicial power throughout the Central Imperial Empire.

Even a divine warrior could not kill him in Tianjing City without causing any commotion.

To imagine controlling Huang Shoujie the way he controls others was impossible.

Despite having similar conditions and opportunities, Ouyang Jie and Huang Shoujie were of completely different caliber and attracted different levels of attention.

Locking him in the position of the Chief Judicial Officer was already an extraordinary accomplishment.

This was the core area, core position, and core figure of the Central Imperial Empire!

But Huang Shoujie didn't need Ouyang Jie's life. He already had the Judicial Iron Whip in his hands.

Soon, two senior officers brought Lou Jiangyue, covered by a layer of cloth on the outside of the prison cart, to the courtyard.

The cloth was used to hide the appearance of the prisoner and prevent any recognition.The Chief of the Investigation Department is not usually so friendly to prisoners... but after all, this is the daughter of Lou Yue, brought back by Ouyang Jie himself from the Imperial Censorate. They didn't need a sedan chair to carry her, which was already quite proper. 

Huang Shoujie glanced casually at the prison carriage and said nonchalantly, "This is an order from the Chief. There's no need to make a special request. You two will lead the way, and we will go to the Central Dungeon."

In this way, they avoided the issue of unfamiliar trusted individuals, and it would be easier to avoid exposure by assigning someone familiar with Huang Shoujie.

The hounds in the Yanshou Office were sharp-nosed creatures.

He added, "If there is anything urgent at the office, transfer it to the other two secretaries. If it cannot be resolved, wait for me to handle it when I return. Do not disturb the Chief."

The subordinates all nodded in agreement.

The two officers from the Investigation Department were happy to carry the prisoner carriage into the official carriage, heading towards the Central Dungeon.

The "Three Offices of the Imperial City" sounded like a system, but in reality, each operated independently, completely distinct from one another. However, after so many years of cooperation, they were quite familiar with each other.

Given Lou Jiangyue's status and crimes, she was destined to descend to the lowest level of the Central Dungeon.

The carriage from the Investigation Department stopped outside the Central Dungeon, the prisoner carriage stopped at the first gate within the Central Dungeon, and the two officers from the Investigation Department stopped at the third gate.

The group was gradually stripped layer by layer.On this lowest level, only Huang Shoujie led Lou Jiangyue away.

The guards at the door, locked in the stone helmet, only told them to keep moving forward, without any other instructions.

Tick! Tick! Tick!
The constant dripping sound was like a cruel cutting.

Those imprisoned here were all being tortured by time.

In the pitch-black darkness, walking a deep and endless path, the only sound was the dripping that seemed to last forever, suffocating people to the point of wanting to crush their own hearts.

Fortunately, Lou Jiangyue was like a walking corpse, and Huang Shoujie had no taboos.

They slowly moved forward until they emerged from the deep darkness and saw the extremely thin and hunched Sang Xianshou.

The Emperor pardoned Lou Jiangyue's death sentence, giving him an indefinite sentence.

Of course, this could not be given as a direct order.

But Sang Xianshou, who managed the central prison, naturally knew the outcome and was better able to weigh Lou Yue's importance.

After all, the Criminal Investigation Department was not a place specifically for holding prisoners, so moving Lou Jiangyue to the central prison was a logical step.

Although Sang Xianshou had not received prior notice, a senior official from the Judicial Department personally led the prisoner over, so there was no issue in terms of protocol.

"Huang Director." Sang Xianshou's voice was cold: "A rare visitor indeed."

"Hopefully it won't be me next time." Huang Shoujie responded.He took a look at him and said, "The suspect has been brought here. Please verify her identity, Master Sang."

"No problem. It is indeed...Lou Jiangyue," Sang Xianshou confirmed.

"In that case, I'll take my leave," Huang Shoujie said as he turned around. He came in clean, and he left decisively.

No one, not even the Chief of the Taoist Court, wanted to stay in the central prison for long.

Lou Jiangyue kept her head down, hair covering her face, motionless and silent as if she were already dead, but she was still alive.

Sang Xianshou, accustomed to people resigning themselves to death, didn't find it surprising.

He just stood in the darkness, silently watching Huang Shoujie leave, ensuring no unexpected incidents occurred. He then put away the prison bell that had been in his hand the whole time – not specifically because of Huang Shoujie, but he maintained a sufficient level of vigilance for anyone who came here.

If there was any interruption in the transmission of his divine thoughts, the prison bell would ring, and the entire central prison would be sealed off. The highest level of alert since the inception of the prison would be triggered.

No matter when, no matter what happens, this place always remains prepared for the most unpredictable dangers.

Of course, such danger has never materialized.

He, Sang Xianshou, was just a gatekeeper.

It was indeed troublesome for the daughter of Lou Yue to be brought here. Not only could she not be tortured, but a slight mishap would also bring consequences.

Lou Yue's daughter being brought here was truly a headache. Not only could she not be tormented, but any minor incident would also be his responsibility. The central dungeon is not a place of healing, not at all.

 It is difficult to find a less painful place.

 Sang Xianshou sighed, pulled the chains off Lou Jiangyue, and with her in tow, headed into the darkness.

 The chains clinked, clattering.

 The sound of dripping, tick, tock, tick.

 Even in the deepest part of the central dungeon, darkness does not last forever.

 At the fixed time each day, when the morning star appears, light will come.

 It just so happened that this moment arrived.

 Exactly when Sang Xianshou was dragging Lou Jiangyue into the darkness. On a night in Tianjing City, the arrival of the Morning Star.

 On the dark ceiling of the central dungeon's deepest part, there was a single ray of light. Passing through the narrow bars, it fell on the ground, forming a very beautiful "well" character.

 Its beauty did not come from the shape of the character, but from the fact that it represented the only hope in this place.

 Human affairs, unknown to heaven.

 The moon in the well, knows what year?

 It has been unknown for many years.

 Time flows like a dream!

 Like every year, every day in the past. The daylight appears only for a moment.

 This "well" character gradually dimmed.

 In the moment of its total disappearance.In the center of the "well" character, two Jingguo characters appeared. The two characters that are closest to the Daoist script are... "Fengshan."

These two characters came with the light and also vanished with the light.

It repeats day after day, from the past to the present to the future, never changing, as if eternal.

But an unexpected event occurred today.

The word "as if" is very interesting, it means "seems like" or "like."

But it's also like saying... "pseudo-Buddha."

As if is not real Buddha!

So, the feeling of eternity that seems eternal is not real.

Huang Shoujie came here today, bringing the Judicial Department's Judicial Whip, which has been worshipped for nearly four thousand years.

This whip was personally bestowed by Jing Taizu Ji Yusu, representing the highest judicial authority of the Central Empire—beyond all worldly customs, regardless of royal kin!

Also... the power of this era, the voice of this era!

Before the "well" character completely faded, the stern whip shadow was just a line. Falling on the well, like the shadows of branches watching the moon in the well.

So the two words "Fengshan" silently separated and silently shattered!

This is not the "Fengshan" of worshiping heaven and earth.

But— 

It sealed the "zen"!

Ouyang Xie sat upright in the main hall, with the interrogation iron whip behind him, like a horizontal official hat.

He furrowed his brows because he had just received a reply from the head of the Diligent and Hardworking Academy, Zuoqiu Wu, which contained too much information that needed to be pondered over word by word.

He and Zuoqiu Wu had a private relationship.

Many people knew about this, so it was not a secret.

During the Central Empire's suppression of the Egalitarian Nation, Zuoqiu Wu was able to quickly bring the academy's teacher, Zheng Wulouming Bi, to surrender, which was due to this reason.

Of course, it was also because there was no evidence linking Zuoqiu Wu to the Egalitarian Nation, combined with the academy's influence and consistent upright stance, that this special treatment was possible.

Zuoqiu Wu's reply was in response to the questions he had asked in his earlier letter.

At that time, when he returned from the East Sea, he was shocked to see a bug leaving his body.Chapter 2463 The Enthronement

Ouyangjie sat upright in the main hall, with the judicial iron whip behind him, like a decoration on his official hat.

He furrowed his brows, as just received a reply from the headmaster of the Diligent and Hardworking Academy, Zuoqiu Wu, with too much information to ponder word by word.

He had a personal relationship with Zuoqiu Wu.

This was something many people knew, not a secret.

During the previous Central Empire's suppression of the Equal Nations, Zuoqiu Wu was able to quickly bring in the head teacher of the academy, Zheng Wuloumingbi, to surrender, due to this reason.

Of course, it was also because there was absolutely no evidence linking Zuoqiu Wu to the Equal Nations, combined with the influence that the Diligent and Hardworking Academy possessed, as well as the academy's consistent upright stance, that allowed this special treatment.

Zuoqiu Wu's reply was in response to the questions he had asked in his earlier letter.
